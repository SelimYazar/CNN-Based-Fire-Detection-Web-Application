# CNN-Based-Fire-Detection-Web-Application

This project implements a deep learning-based fire detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained in Python via Google Colab and saved as model.pth. The backend is developed with the Django framework, which integrates the trained model for processing fire-related images. The frontend is designed using HTML and CSS, allowing users to upload images for real-time fire detection.
